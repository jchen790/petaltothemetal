# Dandelion

Web game where the user presses the arrow keys to fill a board with dandelions.

This game began at HackGT 2016 when a group of students decided this would be the next big thing! ...or at least a cool project to code and learn from. Fast forward several years and this fork was created to redo the game using React and improve on the initial design of the game.
